# Cat and Mouse Animation

A delightful interactive animation built with JavaScript using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [p5.play](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) libraries.

## 📝 Description

This project features a simple storyline set in a garden:
1.  A **Mouse** stands and teases the cat.
2.  A **Cat** walks towards the mouse from the other side of the screen.
3.  When the cat reaches the mouse (collision detection), the interaction concludes:
    - The cat stops moving and displays a happy animation.
    - The mouse reacts with a happy gesture.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  **Navigate** to the project folder.
3.  **Open** the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

> **Tip:** If images do not load when opening the file directly, try running it through a local server (such as the "Live Server" extension in VS Code) to bypass browser security restrictions on local files.
